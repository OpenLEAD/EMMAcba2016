Hydropower runner's blades are typically eroded by cavitation and abrasion
phenomena, resulting in hydraulic profile deformation, thus efficiency
reduction. The High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) coating process is a preventive
solution for erosion, and creates a lamellar structure, increasing
power generation efficiency. 

The runner's blade HVOF process consists of spraying coating particles by an
8~kg spray gun. To achieve the best coating layer, the spray gun should be at a
fixed 230~mm to 240~mm distance and $90^o \pm 30^o$ angle in respect
to the metallic surface plane of the blade; it should move with 40 m/s speed
along the blade; and a 3~mm coating step for full blade cover, due to the 5~mm
diameter flame.

In the case of the Jirau hydroelectric dam, the coating of turbine's blades is
performed before turbine assembling and installation. However, the abrasion due
to a large number of particles and sediment in the Madeira river and the recent
identified cavitation require recoating in short intervals \citep{santa2009slurry}.
