\section{The hard coating process}\label{hvof}

Hydropower runner's blades are typically eroded by cavitation and abrasion
phenomena, resulting in hydraulic profile deformation, thus efficiency
reduction. The High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) coating is a preventive
solution for erosion, and creates a lamellar structure. 

The HVOF is a 2000~hp power process which consists of
spraying coating particles by an 8~kg spray gun, through a flame with mixed
hazardous gases. To achieve the best coating layer, the spray gun should be at
a fixed 210~mm to 240~mm distance, and $90^\circ \pm 30^\circ$ angle, in respect
to the metallic surface plane of the blade; the gun should move at 40~m/min
speed along the path; and the coating step (nozzle's diameter) should be 3~mm
for a regular full blade cover \cite{li2002effect}. The
common solution which meets the requirements for \textit{ex situ} HVOF coating
is a robotic manipulator with a blade-sized workspace in a fixed position.

\section{The problem}\label{problem}

The problem is to design a robotic system for \textit{in situ}
hydropower runner's blades. The system must overcome turbine's environmental
aspects, such as, the confined space and turbine's access, the slippery and
sloping floor, and the unfriendly atmospheric conditions. Besides the mechanical
challenges (locomotion and base rigidity), there are several control and
calibration problems, as path planning, localization and mapping.

A bulb type turbine has the following points of interest for solution
development: 1) the variable pitch propeller, or Kaplan \textbf{blades}; 2) the
variable pitch guide vanes, or \textbf{wicket gates}; 3) the \textbf{runner
area}; 4) the \textbf{draft tube}; and 5) an access for regular
maintenance, or \textbf{hatch}. The Jirau's turbine is the case study of EMMA,
thus a 3D CAD model was built with SolidWorks\raisebox{1ex}{\textregistered}
for simulation and solution analysis (Fig.~\ref{fig::ambiente3d}).
