\section{The hard coating process}\label{hvof}

Hydropower runner's blades are typically eroded by cavitation and abrasion
phenomena, resulting in hydraulic profile deformation, thus efficiency
reduction. The High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) coating is a preventive
solution for erosion, and creates a lamellar structure. 

The HVOF is a 2000~hp power process which consists of
spraying coating particles by an 8~kg spray gun, through a flame with mixed
hazardous gases. To achieve the best coating layer, the spray gun should be at
a fixed 210~mm to 240~mm distance, and $90^\circ \pm 30^\circ$ angle, in respect
to the metallic surface plane of the blade; the gun should move at 40~m/min
speed along the path; and the coating step (nozzle's diameter) should be 3~mm
for a regular full blade cover \cite{li2002effect}. The
common solution which meets the requirements for \textit{ex situ} HVOF coating
is a robotic manipulator with a blade-sized workspace in a fixed position.

\section{The problem}\label{problem}

The problem is to design a robotic system for \textit{in situ}
hydropower runner's blades. Accessibility is a major problem: the robot must be
brought to the turbine through a hatch; and it must operate in the confined,
curved and slippery environment of the turbine at unfriendly atmospheric
conditions. The mechanical challenges are robot locomotion, base stiffness, and
fixation. Besides, there are several control and calibration problems, as
trajectory planning, and robot localization.

Regarding calibration, the relative position between the manipulator and the
blade is not fixed. The system calibration consists in the identification of
the manipulator and blade, and their pose estimation in respect to the turbine
interior. Due to the environment's light conditions, a 3D laser sensing
technology should be used to map the topography of the blade, and the robotic
system. 

Large-sized manipulators are not suitable for \textit{in situ} operations, due
to the accessibility, and conventional compact manipulators do not
have the required work envelope or payload for the task. Therefore,
customized or mid-sized manipulators should be investigated by kinematics and
dynamics simulations. Besides, the modeling of curvilinear space,
the automatically trajectory generation, and the robot position and velocity
control comprise the robot control strategy.


\begin{comment}

A bulb type turbine has the following points of interest for solution
development: 1) the variable pitch propeller, or Kaplan \textbf{blades}; 2) the
variable pitch guide vanes, or \textbf{wicket gates}; 3) the \textbf{runner
area}; 4) the \textbf{draft tube}; and 5) an access for regular
maintenance, or \textbf{hatch}. The Jirau's turbine is the case study of EMMA,
thus a 3D CAD model was built with SolidWorks\raisebox{1ex}{\textregistered}
for simulation and solution analysis (Fig.~\ref{fig::ambiente3d}).
