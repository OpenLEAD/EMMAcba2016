The conceptual solution of EMMA is a mid-sized robotic manipulator with a
modular rail base. As the manipulator cannot fully cover the blade's surface in
a fixed position, and the robot locomotion is complex in the turbine's
environment, a customized rail should provide extra degrees of freedom (DOF) to
the system. EMMA aims to be a generic solution to bulb turbines, being modular,
and versatile. It is an autonomous system for hard coating applications, thus
the following system's elements will be presented: the robotic manipulator; the
customized base; and the robot calibration.


\subsection{Robotic Manipulator}\label{manipulator}
Trying to propose an \textit{in situ} hard coating solution similar to
the \textit{ex situ} solution is a natural thought. Therefore, the first step of
EMMA's development was the research for industrial robotic manipulators. The
HVOF coating requirements and environment constraints demand a mid-sized
robotic manipulator, as seen in Sec.~\ref{problem} a large-sized one would not
be able to move inside the confined space, and a small-sized manipulator would not
have the required payload and speed. In EMMA's project, the
robotic manipulator will be responsible for the coating application, precision, and tool handling.

A market survey was conducted to determine the most suitable robotic
manipulator for the application. Overall simu\-lations and analysis were performed using the Open
Robotics Automation Virtual Environment (OpenRave) \cite{diankov2008openrave},
an environment for simulating motion planning algorithms for robotics. There are
several tools for dynamics simulation of robots, as Gazebo, V-Rep,
Webots, MatLab/Simulink, and others \cite{ivaldi2014tools}. OpenRave stands out
for having the following features: integral desgin for real-time control and
execution monitoring; core functionality for kinematics operations and
physics simulations; a network protocol allowing interpreted scripting languages
like Octave and Matlab; built-in core tools and plugin interfaces for
manipulation planning; standard plugins that allow testing of different planning
algorithms and sensing systems; ROS compatibility.

OpenRAVE has been used to write robust manipulation
scripts that have been tuned and tested on multiple robot systems for the past 2 years.


The simulations involve runner's blade discretization, base
positions computation for full blade cover, and robotic manipulator's kinematics
and dynamics. 

The blade's surface discretization is an uniform sampling to
determine where to the coating directions should be. However, sampling the
actual geometric surface can lead to unwanted results due to possible
concavities. A simpler approach is to take the bounding box of the blade and
sample its surface uniformly. Once the
surface of the box is sampled, the intersection of the blade and a ray
originating from each point going inward is taken. The normal of the blade's
surface from each of these intersection points is taken to be the coating
direction. As an uniform sampling of the box does not mean an uniform sampling
of the blade, the box is oversampled and a 50~mm filter is applied, by a multidimensional search key with k-d tree.
The samples are translated 230~mm in respect with their normal vectors,
collision checks with the environment are made, and the feasible samples are
named \textit{coating samples}. 

Base position computation is to uniformly sample the turbine's
confined space and to calculate the required robotic manipulator's base
positions to process all the \textit{coating samples},  considering angle and
distance tolerances. It is a brute force search: for each position, inverse
kinematics are computed to determine the robotic manipulator's joint parameters that provide
the desired positions and orientations of the end-effector.

The kinematic approach described above is not enough to ensure that the robot
will reach the \textit{coating samples}. Maximum accelerations, decelerations,
torques, and jacobian singularities should be investigated and compared to the robotic
manipulator's specifications. The Newton-Euler method
\cite{sciavicco2000differential} was adopted for torque computation: $\tau =
M(q)\alpha + C(q,\omega)\omega + G(q)$, where $\tau$ is the joints' torques,
$M$ is the matrix of links' masses and moments of inertia, $\alpha$ is the
joints' accelerations, $q$ is the joints' angles, $\omega$ is the joints'
velocities, $C$ is the Coriolis matrix, and $G$ is the gravity vector.

In the dynamic approach, $M$ was estimated by the robotic manipulator's CAD
model. The angular accelerations are derived by differential kinematics:
$\alpha=J^+(a-\omega^TH\omega)$, where $H$ is the Hessian matrix
\cite{hourtash2005kinematic}, $a=\ddot{X}$ is the linear accelerations, and $J$
is the Jacobian matrix. Therefore, torques can be analytically estimated with
the inverse dynamics in OpenRave. 

% The typical path of HVOF coating is a zigzagging trajectory,
% i.e., it is a deceleration and acceleration process with direction changes. As
% the \textit{ex situ} solution uses a large-sized robotic manipulator, the
% end-effector's direction changes occur outside the blade's range, complying the
% speed requirement in the blade's range. However, while deceleration or
% acceleration, coating material is wasted to the environment or, most commonly,
% to a shadow plate.
% 
% The mid-sized robot for \textit{in situ} operation makes this strategy
% impossible, as, at some base positions, the robot will always be in the blade's
% range. The proposed solution modifies the original circuit of the gases that
% carry the coating particles to a new 2-way controlled circuit, in which there is
% a directional valve that changes the flow path from the thermal spray gun to return to tank
% circuit. The directional valve is autonomously actuated accordingly to the robotic
% manipulator's trajectory, i.e., the valve will ``shut'' while end-effector
% changes its direction. Therefore, the solution provides coating material
% savings, as the non-used particles are stored for future usage, and the hard
% coating speed requirement is met.

\subsection{Base}

EMMA's base comprises two rails, forming two prismatic joints (P). The
first, or primary rail, is parallel to the turbine axis, and it is responsible
for the transportation of the robotic manipulator from hatch to blade. The
secondary rail is parallel to the blade's surface, and it is assembled from the
first rail by a rotational joint (R). A third prismatic joint
is placed in the secondary rail for height adjustment of the robotic
manipulator. These rails guarantee the full coating, as they allow the
robotic manipulator movement in the confined space by a 4-DOF base, PRPP joints.

\end{figure}

The hatch limits the size of the rail in terms of weight and geometry, thus a
modular concept was design, such that the small modular parts can be easily and
manually assembled inside the turbine. The base is a modular two parallel
profiled rail with a four carriage setup  \cite{SKF_2013}. In this
configuration, the reaction moments of the base are cancelled by a force couple provided by each couple of
carriages. The commercial modules are aluminum structures for corrosion resistance,
lightweight, geometric flexibility, and modularity, as it is possible to
increase/decrease the rail length/width/height by changing few parts or adding
anchor arms.

The resulting base is a slender and lightweight frame, such that a careful
analysis is necessary to evaluate the structural integrity and rigidity in
respect to the dynamic loads of the robotic manipulator. A Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) was performed to study the stresses, strains and resultant forces
along the structure. FEA is also used to size the frame components, such as
the profile's size, and to size the anchors, its directions, and attachment to
provide the greater base's rigidity. The rigidity is a major concern, it is
required for the hard coating process, since a non-rigid base propagates
vibrations to the robotic manipulator's end-effector with high amplitudes, which
may compromise coating quality.

The draft tube and runner area are conical shape structures, curved and
sloped. The environment modification, as wielding and drilling, should be
avoided, thus properly fixing the base on the ground is a major challenge in
EMMA project. The draft tube is composed of a ferromagnetic steel material,
hence magnetic fixtures may be suitable for base attachment. 

Common magnetic fixture products are temporary magnetic equipments used to hoist
and transport materials in an industrial plant. In EMMA, it is used to attach
and anchor the rail's modules to the ground. 


\subsection{Calibration}

In opposition to \textit{ex situ} operations, in which the relative position
between the robot and the blade to be coated is fixed, \textit{in situ}
operation requires environment mapping and robot localization. In
EMMA, system calibration is robot and blade identification, and pose estimation in
respect to the environment. A 3D laser scanner is placed inside the hydraulic
circuit for mapping and a point cloud is generated.
 
The attachment of markers on the robotic manipulator can be performed with high
precision and repeatability, thus reflective spheres were chosen as reference
in the process of robot localization. These spheres are identified inside the
point cloud by a 3D Hough transform method \cite{camurri20143d}.

The pose estimation relies on the intrinsec properties of the blade's surface
geometry. Therefore, a point cloud of the model of the blade is generated, and
it is compared to the point cloud of the scene, acquired by the 3D laser sensor
\cite{Tombari2010a}. The characteristics of the blade are represented by a local
descriptor, i.e., each point of interest on the blade is associated with the
information about its local neighborhood. The two point clouds are subsampled
and have the feature descriptors associated to the points of interest. Given the
sets of features,  it is possible to determine the correspondence between the
two sets. If enough correspondences are found in the scene, above a threshold,
the blade is identified and the position is determined.
