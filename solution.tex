The conceptual solution of EMMA is a mid-sized robotic manipulator with a
modular rail base. As the manipulator can not fully cover the blade's surface in
a fixed position, and the robot locomotion is complex in the turbine's
environment, a customized rail should provide extra degrees of freedom (DOF) to
the system. EMMA aims to be a generic solution to bulb turbines, being modular,
and versatile. It is an autonomous system for hard coating applications, thus
the following system's elements will be presented: the robotic manipulator; the
customized base; and the robot calibration.


\subsection{Robotic Manipulator}\label{manipulator}
Trying to propose an \textit{in situ} hard coating solution similar to
the \textit{ex situ} solution is a natural thought. Therefore, the first step of
EMMA's development was the research for industrial robotic manipulators. The
HVOF coating requirements and environment constraints demand a mid-sized
robotic manipulator, as seen in Sec.~\ref{problem} a large-sized one would not
be able to move inside the confined space, and a small-sized manipulator would not
have the required payload and speed. In EMMA's project, the
robotic manipulator will be responsible for the coating application, precision, and tool handling.

A market survey was conducted to determine the most suitable robotic
manipulator for the application. A 3D CAD model of the hydropower turbine was
built, and overall simu\-lations and analysis were performed using the Open
Robotics Automation Virtual Environment (OpenRave) \cite{diankov2008openrave}.
The simulations involve runner's blade discretization, coating strategy, base
positions computation for full blade cover, and robotic manipulator's kinematics
and dynamics. Among the analyzed mid-sized robotic manipulators, the Yaskawa Motoman MH12
robot was chosen due to its satisfactory workspace, and versatility.

The typical path of HVOF coating is a zigzagging trajectory,
i.e., it is a deceleration and acceleration process with direction changes. As
the \textit{ex situ} solution uses a large-sized robotic manipulator, the
end-effector's direction changes occur outside the blade's range, complying the
speed requirement in the blade's range. However, while deceleration or
acceleration, coating material is wasted to the environment or, most commonly,
to a shadow plate.

The mid-sized robot for \textit{in situ} operation makes this strategy
impossible, as, at some base positions, the robot will always be in the blade's
range. The proposed solution modifies the original circuit of the gases that
carry the coating particles to a new 2-way controlled circuit, in wich there is a directional
valve that changes the flow path from the thermal spray gun to return to tank
circuit. The directional valve is autonomously actuated accordingly to the robotic
manipulator's trajectory, i.e., the valve will ``shut'' while end-effector
changes its direction. Therefore, the solution provides coating material
savings, as the non-used particles are stored for future usage, and the hard
coating speed requirement is met.

Despite being able to coat approximately 50\% of the blade on a fixed
position, kinematic and dynamic analysis show that the MH12 robot cannot fully
cover it vertically or horizontally, demanding extra 2-DOF along the blade's
surface. The coating strategy reveals that the blade's top
extremities require an specific base position, reachable
with a primary rail between the blades. Therefore, the MH12 robot will require
at least four positions along the blade and one position on a primary
rail, between blades. 

\subsection{Base}
% 0.75 pages

EMMA's base comprises two rails, forming two prismatic joints (P). The
first, or primary rail, is parallel to the turbine axis, and it is responsible
for the transportation of the robotic manipulator from hatch to blade. The
secondary rail is parallel to the blade's surface, and it is assembled from the
first rail by a rotational joint (R). A third prismatic joint
is placed in the secondary rail for height adjustment of the robotic
manipulator. These rails guarantee the full coating, as they allow the
robotic manipulator movement in the confined space by a 4-DOF base, PRPP joints.

\end{figure}

The hatch limits the size of the rail in terms of weight and geometry, thus a
modular concept was design, such that the small modular parts can be easily and
manually assembled inside the turbine. The base is a modular two parallel
profiled rail  %TODO Estevao: colocar referencia
with a four carriage setup. In this configuration, the reaction moments of the
base are cancelled by a force couple provided by each couple of carriages. The
commercial modules are aluminum structures for corrosion resistance,
lightweight, geometric flexibility, and modularity, as it is possible to
increase/decrease the rail length/width/height by changing few parts or adding
anchor arms.

The resulting base is a slender and lightweight frame, such that a careful
analysis is necessary to evaluate the structural integrity and rigidity in
respect to the dynamic loads of the robotic manipulator. A Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) was performed to study the stresses, strains and resultant forces
along the structure. FEA is also used to size the frame components, such as
the profile's size, and to size the anchors, its directions, and attachment to
provide the greater base's rigidity. The rigidity is a major concern, it is
required for the hard coating process, since a non-rigid base propagates
vibrations to the robotic manipulator's end-effector with high amplitudes, which
may compromise coating quality.

The draft tube and runner area are conical shape structures, curved and
sloped. The environment modification, as wielding and drilling, should be
avoided, thus properly fixing the base on the ground is a major challenge in
EMMA project. The draft tube is composed of a ferromagnetic steel material,
hence magnetic fixtures may be suitable for base attachment. 

Common magnetic fixture products are temporary magnetic equipments used to hoist
and transport materials in an industrial plant. In EMMA, it is used to attach
and anchor the rail's modules to the ground. Field tests were conducted in the
draft tube for payload evaluation, at different equipment's orientations and
places.


\subsection{Calibration}

In opposition to \textit{ex situ} operations, in which the relative position
between the robot and the blade to be coated is fixed, \textit{in situ}
operation requires environment mapping and robot localization. In
EMMA, system calibration is robot and blade identification, and pose estimation in
respect to the environment. A 3D laser scanner is placed inside the hydraulic
circuit for mapping and a point cloud is generated.
 
The attachment of markers on the robotic manipulator can be
performed with high precision and repeatability, thus reflective spheres were
choosen as reference in the process of robot localization. These spheres are indetified inside the point cloud by a 3D Hough
transform method \cite{camurri20143d}. 

Alternatively, the pose estimation of the blade cannot be assisted with the
introduction of markers, and the localization process must rely
only on the intrinsec properties of the blade's surface geometry. 
Therefore, a  model of blade's is generated as a point cloud and it is compared to the point cloud of
the scene aquired by the 3D laser sensor \cite{Tombari2010a}.
The caracteristics of the blade are represented by a local descriptor, i.e. each
point of interest on the blade is associated with the information about its
local neighborhood. The two point clouds are, then, subsampled and have the
feature descriptors associated to the points of interest. Given the sets of features, 
it is possible to determine the correspondence between the two sets. If enough correspondences are found in
the scene, above a threshold, the blade is identified and the position is
determined by the correspondences.
