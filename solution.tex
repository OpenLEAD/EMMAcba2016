The coating solution used in industry today is to oversize the robot
in means of its reach, such that one fixed and large base is enough to do all 
the process without moving the robot's base. 
This is feasible because there are no constraints regarding to its size and no
other objects but the blade in an optimal position, in a specially designed room.

Because of the small access to the interior of the turbine and the narrow space
between the blades, this solution requires a midsize to small robot. 
These manipulator cannot reach all the surface of the blade without moving its
base, so an external base need to provide degrees of freedom (DOF) that allow
the manipulator to reach all the surface.
A geometric and kinematic study was made to find the required positions of the
robot's base that allow the complete coverage of the blade.
From this, were studied several base concepts regarding to the DOF and joints of
the base. The simpler solution in constructive terms was chosen, and consists of
a Prismatic-Rotational-Prismatic-Prismatic (PRPP) joints.

The robot's base comprises two rails, forming two prismatic joints. The first
rail, or primary rail, is responsible for the transportation between the turbine
access and the blade and it is parallel to the turbine axis. The secondary rail
is assembled from the first rail in a direction parallel to the blade's face.
This rails allows the robot to move along the blade and to cover a region of it
at a time. A rotational joint is placed between the two rails and is responsible
for the ajdustment of the angle between them.
Because of the limited reach of the manipulator, a last prismatic joint in the
height direction gives the robot the total reach required to cover all regions
of the blade.

The size of the turbine access limits the dimension of the parts that can get
inside. The solution to this is to have a modular concept for the base, such
that it is possible to enter small parts (modules) and assemble the base inside
the turbine. It shall be easy to mount and dismount the system manually, without
the need of special tools. 

Each rail is composed of two parallel profiled rails with a four carriage setup.
In this configuration the reaction moments of the robot's base are cancelled by
a force couple provided by each couple of carriages and the loads are divided in
ore components.

A comercial modular profile system in aluminum is used to form the main
structure in wich the rails are mounted. 
The main advantages of this kind of system are a corrosion resistant and light
structure with a large flexibility in terms of geometry and modularity so that
it is possible to increase or decrease length, width or height of the structure
changing few parts, add anchor arms and many other accessories quickly.

Because of the constraints to access the turbine, the structure can't be
oversized in terms of weight and geometry. So the result is a slender and ligth
frame, such that a carefull analysis is necessary to evaluate the structural
integrity and deformations due to the dynamic loads from the robot.
A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is performed to study the stresses, strains and
resultant forces along the structure and are used to size the frame components,
like profile size, size of the anchors and its directions and to provide rigidity to the
base.


\subsection{Magnetic bases}

The interior of the turbine is curved and sloped. Besides that it is not
possible to modify its surface permanently, like drilling or welding. So it is a
complicated task to fix the base of the robot properly on the ground.
However, almost all the surface inside is a ferromagnetic steel material, and it
is possible to attach magnetic fixturesin it. The comercial magnetic bases are
non-permanent magnetic equipment used in industry to hoist and transport
materials in a plant. For this solution it is used to attach and anchor the
structure of the base to the ground. Tests were conducted in a sample of
surfaces in order to evaluate the load capacity of this
equipment in the different shapes, surface finishing and curvatures that are
found inside the turbine. The results concluded that this equipment is well
suited for this application.
