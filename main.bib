@article{Tombari2010a,
abstract = {In this work we propose a novel Hough voting approach for the detection of free-form shapes in a 3D space, to be used for object recognition tasks in 3D scenes with a significant degree of occlusion and clutter. The proposed method relies on matching 3D features to accumulate evidence of the presence of the objects being sought in a 3D Hough space. We validate our proposal by presenting a quantitative experimental comparison with state-of-the-art methods as well as by showing how our method enables 3D object recognition from real-time stereo data.},

    abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel software package for the simulation of various types of range scanners. The goal is to provide researchers in the fields of obstacle detection, range data segmentation, obstacle tracking or surface reconstruction with a versatile and powerful software package that is easy to use and allows to focus on algorithmic improvements rather than on building the software framework around it. The simulation environment and the actual simulations can be efficiently distributed with a single compact file. Our proposed approach facilitates easy regeneration of published results, hereby highlighting the value of reproducible research.}},

@article{Rusinkiewicz2001,
abstract = {The ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is widely used for ge- ometric alignment of three-dimensional models when an initial estimate of the relative pose is known. Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the se- lection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.},
